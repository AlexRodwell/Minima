        <h1>Stüssy’s Top 10 Sneaker Collaborations</h1>
        <p>In 2021, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.complex.com/tag/nike">Nike</a> collaborating with streetwear brands has become the norm. Names like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.complex.com/sneakers/ranking-supreme-nike-collaborations/">Supreme</a>, Clot, and Undefeated have been adding to their catalogs of memorable Nike projects for years at this point. But 21 years ago, with the original release of its Air Huarache collab, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.complex.com/style/best-clothing-brands-2020/stussy">Stüssy</a> was the first.</p>
        <p>A well-respected streetwear OG in its own right, Stüssy has faded in and out of the spotlight a handful of times throughout its four-decade history. Over the past two years, it seems to have righted the ship though, especially in the sneaker space. Consistent collaborations with Nike that have included everything from its take on the classic Air Force 1 to a retro release of the Huarache that started it all have reminded plenty of people just how good Stüssy is when it comes to crafting memorable product. And if the past few months are any indication, the output won’t be slowing down soon either.</p>
        <p>With all of the brand’s current momentum, we decided to take a look back at Stüssy’s best sneaker collabs. Check out our detailed top 10 list below.</p>

        <h2>10. Nike All Court Mid</h2>

        <p>As its footwear catalog proves, Stüssy has a tendency to select shoes from the Nike archive that are a bit unexpected when it comes time to celebrate a major milestone.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One</li>
            <li>Two</li>

                    <li>Praesent pulvinar dui eget fermentum consequat.</li>
                    <li>Proin dictum tristique dolor, vitae convallis diam fermentum sit amet.</li>
                    <li>Etiam ut lacus lacinia, facilisis mi id, ornare lacus.</li>
                    <li>In dictum scelerisque ante, eu efficitur sem efficitur id.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Four</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As its footwear catalog proves, Stüssy has a tendency to select shoes from the Nike archive that are a bit unexpected when it comes time to celebrate a major milestone. Case in point, the brand’s decision to celebrate its 30th anniversary with a trio of All Court Mids in 2010. Incredibly similar to the much more common Blazer, the All Court Mid sets itself apart with a rubber toe cap. Black and white leather versions would be released to the public with the third blue canvas option being limited to friends and family. Each shared details like tan snakeskin Swooshes, SS logos on the tongue tag, three royal blue top eyelets, and a commemorative “XXX” marking on the insole. “Nike” etched across each heel tab in Stüssy’s signature font is the perfect finishing touch. Appropriately given the timeframe these dropped, the release was accompanied by a Nike Destroyer jacket and graphic T-shirt. —Mike DeStefano</p>

        <p>It only seemed right that a legendary brand in streetwear history would give its own take on a true Nike icon: the Air Force 1. Stüssy followed up its Nike Air Zoom Spiridon Cage 2 collab in late 2020 with a similarly styled duo of Forces. The black and natural hemp colorways featured Stüssy branding on the tongue tag, a faux fur heel with a Stüssy logo badge, and a woven toe logo. A large, tonal embroidered Swoosh served as a centerpiece of the design. The brand took the popularity of customizing its aforementioned project a step further in early 2021, teaming with Los Angeles’ Lookout & Wonderland, an art practice specializing in plant-based color, on five different hand-dyed colorways of its AF1 in blue, yellow, purple, green, and red. The five versions were created to represent each of its World Tour cities: New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, London, and Paris. —Zac Dubasik</p>

        <p>Stüssy’s history of releasing special Nike shoes stretches back to before the time when Nike releasing special shoes with an outside entity was a common thing. In fact, the shoes widely considered the first Stüssy x Nike collaboration—we’ll get to those later—were less of a true partnership product and more of a store exclusive. The streetwear brand’s own descriptions of its Nike archive instead point to this duo of Dunks from 2001 as the “first official Nike collaboration with a clothing company.” The shoes introduced new materials to the Dunk, like ostrich and snakeskin, which were a rarity for the model at the time. They also helped introduce a new era of limited release where stores would trickle out pairs to eager consumers. The 2001 Dunk Highs were available only at the New York, London, Tokyo, and Los Angeles Stüssy stores, which dropped just 24 pairs each (12 of the black and 12 of the brown) per day until their stock was depleted. —Brendan Dunne</p>

        <p>The Nike Air Zoom Spiridon Cage 2 was originally introduced in 2003 as a specialty runner intended for the Japanese market, and designed to help keep marathoners’ feet dry. It was designed by Steven Smith, a sneaker industry journeyman who currently serves as design director for Kanye West’s Yeezy brand. While the sneaker was well-received and booked in at 800,000 pairs on pre-order, it was quickly forgotten and hasn’t exactly been a staple of sneakerhead and streetwear wardrobes in the years since, like many sneakers in the Air Max line or even the original Zoom Spiridn have. So, it came as a bit of a surprise that Stüssy would rekindle its footwear relationship with Nike on the model; at the time that images first leaked, a retro wasn’t even expected. The collab featured multiple colorways including a silver and black variation that looked like it could have been an OG, but it was the “Fossil” edition, and its ease of customization, that most captivated fans thanks to its natural hemp upper. —Zac Dubasik</p>
