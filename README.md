## An opinionated HTML/CSS (UI) starter project

While this certainly won't please everyone, it's my personal starter point for any project to get started, as it contains many useful Sass functions and mixins to make your life easier. These have been integrated into Sass variables (which in turn put out CSS variables).

Containing the standard base styling you'd expect, with a structured SCSS approach. Featuring modern CSS (with @supports fallback queries), and documentation as to why I choose so.

This is intended as a boilerplate, and should be customised to fit the needs of your website, this just providers a framework/structure around the standard HTML elements like CSS variables, typography and base structure (containers, grids etc)

## Pages

A collection of example page(s) for various standard elements, including:

- Article (structure, meta data)
- Header 

## Goals

Designed to feature accessible HTML that is highly crawlable by search engines
