# Minima

## An opinionated starter HTML/SCSS project, with accessibility in mind

Containing the standard base styling you'd expect, with a structured SCSS approach. Featuring modern CSS (with @supports fallback queries), and documentation as to why I choose so.

This is intended as a boilerplate, and should be customised to fit the needs of your website, this just providers a framework/structure around the standard HTML elements like CSS variables, typography and base structure (containers, grids etc)
